## Problem: Contains Duplicate

Given an array of integers, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### Example:

#### Input:

[1, 2, 3, 1]

#### Output:

true

#### Explanation:

In the given array, the value 1 appears twice, hence the output is true.

### Test Cases:

#### Input:

[1, 2, 3, 4]

#### Output:

false

#### Explanation:

In this case, all elements are distinct, so the output is false.

#### Input:

[1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]

#### Output:

true
