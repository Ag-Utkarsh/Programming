# Two Sum

## Question

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

## Test Cases

1. Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
   Output: [1, 2]

2. Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
   Output: [0, 1]
