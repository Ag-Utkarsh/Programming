# Implementation of Stack Using Queue

## Problem Statement

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the Stack class using queues as the internal data structure.

## Example

Input:
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]

Output:
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

## Constraints

- You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
