# Majority Element Problem

The majority element in an array is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times, where n is the size of the array.

## Example

Given an array: [3, 2, 3]
The majority element is 3, as it appears twice out of the three elements.

## Test Cases

- Input: [3, 2, 3]
  Output: 3

- Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
  Output: 2
